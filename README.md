# Portaudio Handson

## Configuration (for macOS)

Install XCode and get [Portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/download.html). 

On command line, go to the extracted directory and do

```
./configure && make
```

as in Portaudio's [official tutorial](http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/compile_mac_coreaudio.html).

To build, simply use

```
make
```

and if you want to run right after building, use

```
make run
```

finally, use `make clear` to clear all executables.
